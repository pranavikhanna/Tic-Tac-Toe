ðŸ¥‡ Olympic Gold Medal Predictor
This project leverages Python and machine learning to analyze over a century's worth of Olympic gold medal data and predict future gold medal winners by country.

ðŸ“Š Overview
The goal of this project is to explore historical Olympic data, identify trends, and use those insights to forecast which countries are most likely to win future gold medals. Using Python's data structures such as sets, maps, lists, and vectors, this analysis draws from a large dataset of past Olympic performances.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Data Analysis:

Reads and parses historical Olympic gold medal data.

Utilizes Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures for efficient handling of data across multiple decades.

Prediction Model:

Implements neural networks using TensorFlow.

Uses past trends and medal distribution to predict upcoming gold medal winners by country.

Visualization:

Graphs generated from the model to visualize trends and prediction outcomes.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for logic and data handling.

TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network.

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional): For generating graphs.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preparation.
